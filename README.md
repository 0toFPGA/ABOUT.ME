About 0toFPGA
Hey I'm 0toFPGA

*From 0 to FPGA (or Linux Embedded), this plans to be my Embedded Journey into the field!

I am building a full stack of projects to beef up my Resume since I do not have a college degree... 
The goal of this is to actually learn the content, I have limited knowledge and used AI to create a rough guideline of a path that I should take in this journey. 
With that being said I want to actually learn the curriculum and will try to not use AI to solve my problems, 
but instead reach out to professionals or anyone that finds this and can guide me in the right direction!

The ambitious goals that I have for this is as follows:

-Linux Infrastucture (RHCSA and RHCE in progress)

-Embedded Systems (Buildroot, U-Boot, Yocoto)

-FPGA Design (Verilog, Vivado, Zynq SoCs)

-Automation (Ansible, Jenkins, Bash, Python)
